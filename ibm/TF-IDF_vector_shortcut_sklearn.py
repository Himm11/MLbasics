#That was a lot of work. But it is handy to know, if you are asked to code TF-IDF from scratch in the future. However, this can be done a lot simpler thanks to sklearn library. Letâ€™s look at the example from them below:

#first step is to import the library
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
#for the sentence, make sure all words are lowercase or you will run #into error. for simplicity, I just made the same sentence all #lowercase
firstV= "Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st century"
secondV= "machine learning is the key for data science"
#calling the TfidfVectorizer
vectorize= TfidfVectorizer()
#fitting the model and passing our sentences right away:
response= vectorize.fit_transform([firstV, secondV])

print(response)
