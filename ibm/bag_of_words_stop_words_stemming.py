That’s beans. And they were very impressed at my agricultural knowledge.
Please give it up for Amaury once again for that outstanding introduction. 
I have a bunch of good friends here today, including somebody who I served with,
who is one of the finest senators in the country, and we’re lucky to have him, your Senator,
Dick Durbin is here. I also noticed, by the way, former Governor Edgar here, who I haven’t seen in a long time, 
and somehow he has not aged and I have. And it’s great to see you, Governor.
I want to thank President Killeen and everybody at the U of I System for making it possible for me to be here today.
And I am deeply honored at the Paul Douglas Award that is being given to me.
He is somebody who set the path for so much outstanding public service here in Illinois.
Now, I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room. 
I know people are still wondering why I didn’t speak at the commencement.
